## Cleaning Process 
This dashboard was created using Excel, Power Query, and Power BI. The data was cleaned by making surveys exit surveys more easy to understand, deleting two ids that didnâ€™t participate in the survey, and flipping horizontally displayed data.

## Overview

The HR dashboard for the company shows that the headcount is currently at 185 employees, which has increased by 7.56% from the previous year. The company's leavers are currently at 11 for this year, compared to 12 the previous year, indicating that less people are leaving the company. The company's turnover rate of 11.90% is quite low, which is a good sign for the organization. The majority of employees in the company work in the product engineering department.

## Exit Survey Analysis

The main takeaways from the exit survey are that the office proximity and work flexibility are areas that require improvement. These areas received less than 50% positivity from employees, which indicates that the company needs to focus on improving these aspects. To address these concerns, it is recommended that the company implement hybrid options or remote work policies.

## Hiring Trends

Although the company received many applications from LinkedIn, a relatively small number of applicants were offered a position. Nevertheless, the acceptance rate for those who were offered a position was 75.86%. This indicates that the company is effective at attracting top talent, and that those who were recommended had a higher chance of being hired.

## Absenteeism Analysis

The data shows that employees are given an average of 6.71 days of leave. The highest volumes of leaves were taken in June, July, and March, with most being taken for holidays and sick days. 

- June: 22 days for holiday, 8 for sick days.
- February: 13 days for holiday, 8 for sick days.
- April: 13 days for holiday, 5 for sick days.
- May: 11 days for holiday, 8 for sick days.
- March: 9 days for holiday, 14 for sick days.
- January: 9 days for holiday, 11 for sick days.

Based on the patterns identified in employee leave data, we recommend implementing a policy that encourages employees to take their leave evenly throughout the year.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to improve the company's HR performance:

1. Improve office proximity and work flexibility to address employee concerns and improve overall job satisfaction.
2. Continue to attract top talent by focusing on recruiting through platforms such as LinkedIn and consider expanding recruiting efforts beyond LinkedIn to increase the pool of qualified applicants.
3. Offer more hybrid and remote work options to provide employees with more flexibility and work-life balance.
4. Continue to prioritize employee wellness by encouraging them to take leave evenly throughout the year.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can improve employee retention, increase job satisfaction, and attract and retain top talent.
