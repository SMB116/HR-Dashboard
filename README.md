# HR Dashboard Analysis for a Four-Year Company

## Overview

The HR dashboard for the company shows that the headcount is currently at 185 employees, which has increased by 7.56% from the previous year. The company's leavers are currently at 11 for this year, compared to 12 the previous year, indicating that less people are leaving the company. The company's turnover rate of 11.90% is quite low, which is a good sign for the organization. The majority of employees in the company work in the product engineering department.

## Exit Survey Analysis

The main takeaways from the exit survey are that the office proximity and work flexibility are areas that require improvement. These areas received less than 50% positivity from employees, which indicates that the company needs to focus on improving these aspects. To address these concerns, it is recommended that the company implement hybrid options or remote work policies.

## Hiring Trends

Although the company received many applications from LinkedIn, a relatively small number of applicants were offered a position. Nevertheless, the acceptance rate for those who were offered a position was 75.86%. This indicates that the company is effective at attracting top talent, and that those who were recommended had a higher chance of being hired.

## Absenteeism Analysis

The data shows that employees are given an average of 6.71 days of leave. The highest volumes of leaves were taken in June, July, and March, with most being taken for holidays and sick days. It is recommended that the company conduct a more in-depth analysis of absenteeism patterns to identify any potential issues and implement policies to address them.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to improve the company's HR performance:

1. Improve office proximity and work flexibility to address employee concerns and improve overall job satisfaction.
2. Conduct a more thorough analysis of absenteeism patterns to identify any underlying issues and implement policies to address them.
3. Continue to attract top talent by focusing on recruiting through platforms such as LinkedIn.
4. Offer more hybrid and remote work options to provide employees with more flexibility and work-life balance.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can improve employee retention, increase job satisfaction, and attract and retain top talent.
